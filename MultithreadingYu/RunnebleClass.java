/*
 Explanation:
MyTask: Focuses only on what needs to be done (calculating a sum).
TaskRunnable: Wraps the task into a Runnable so it can be run by a thread.
Thread: Handles the running of the task in a separate thread.


Here, we separate the task (what is being done) from the thread (which handles the execution), providing better design flexibility. You can now reuse the MyTask class in different places or run it in different threads without changing the task itself.

Purpose of TaskRunnable: The TaskRunnable class serves as a wrapper for the MyTask object, allowing the task to be executed in a separate thread. By implementing Runnable
